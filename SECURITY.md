## Reporting a Vulnerability

This software is no longer maintained.
The software has the sole purpose of wiping computers, it wipes itself in the process, if wipes are successful the software is destroyed.
If there are vulnerabilities in the software, it matters less than normal software because the software wipes itself. 
This rationale is for users to decide on, themselves.
